;;; Commentary:

;; Implementation notes
;; --------------------
;;
;; Use defsubst instead of defun
;;
;; * Using bitmaps to check for matches worked out to be SLOWER than just
;;   scanning the string and using `flx-get-matches'.
;;
;; * Consing causes GC, which can often slowdown Emacs more than the benefits
;;   of an optimization.

  "List of characters that act as word separators in flx"
  :type '(repeat character)
  :group 'flx)

(defface flx-highlight-face  '((t (:inherit font-lock-variable-name-face :bold t :underline t)))
  "Face used by flx for highlighting flx match characters."
  :group 'flx)

;;; Do we need more word separators than ST?


(defun flx-make-filename-cache ()
  '(t))

(defun flx-score (str query &optional case)
  "Return best score matching QUERY against STR"
  (calc-score query str))


(defvar flx-file-cache nil
  "Cached heatmap info about strings.")

;;; reset value on every file load.
(setq flx-file-cache (flx-make-filename-cache))

(provide 'flx)

;;; flx.el ends here
